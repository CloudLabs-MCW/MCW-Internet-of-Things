## Exercise 2: Completing the Smart Meter Simulator

Duration: 60 minutes

Fabrikam has left you a partially completed sample in the form of the Smart Meter Simulator solution. You will need to complete the missing lines of code that deal with device registration management and device telemetry transmission that communicate with your IoT Hub.

### Task 1: Implement device management with the IoT Hub

1. In **Visual Studio** on your **Lab VM**, use **Solution Explorer**, navigate go to **C:\SmartMeter\MCW-Internet-of-Things-main\Hands-on lab\lab-files\starter-project** and open the file **DeviceManager.cs**.

2. From the Visual Studio **View** menu, choose **Task List**.

   ![On the Visual Studio View menu, Task List is selected.](media/visual-studio-view-menu-task-list.png 'Visual Studio View menu')

3. In the **Task List**, you will see a list of **TODO** tasks, where each task represents one line of code that needs to be completed. Complete the line of code below each **TODO** using the code below as a reference. If your task list is blank, complete TODO steps 1-5 as indicated in the code in the next step.

4. The following code represents the completed tasks in **DeviceManager.cs**:

   ```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Security.Cryptography;
    using System.Text;
    using System.Threading.Tasks;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Client;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Provisioning.Client.Transport;
    using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Shared;

    namespace SmartMeterSimulator
    {
        class DeviceManager
        {            
            /// <summary>

            /// <returns></returns>
            public async static Task<SmartMeterDevice> RegisterDeviceAsync(string enrollmentKey, string idScope, string deviceId)
            {
                var globalEndpoint = "global.azure-devices-provisioning.net";
                SmartMeterDevice device = null;
                
                //TODO: 1. Derive a device key from a combination of the group enrollment key and the device id
                var primaryKey = ComputeDerivedSymmetricKey(enrollmentKey, deviceId);

                //TODO: 2. Create symmetric key with the generated primary key
                using (var security = new SecurityProviderSymmetricKey(deviceId, primaryKey, null))
                using (var transportHandler = new ProvisioningTransportHandlerMqtt())
                {
                    //TODO: 3. Create a Provisioning Device Client
                    var client = ProvisioningDeviceClient.Create(globalEndpoint, idScope, security, transportHandler);

                    //TODO: 4. Register the device using the symmetric key and MQTT
                    DeviceRegistrationResult result = await client.RegisterAsync();

                    //TODO: 5. Populate the device provisioning details
                    device = new SmartMeterDevice()
                    {
                        AuthenticationKey = primaryKey,
                        DeviceId = deviceId,
                        IoTHubHostName = result.AssignedHub
                    };
                }
                
                //return the device
                return device;
            }

            /// <summary>
            /// Compute a symmetric key for the provisioned device from the enrollment group symmetric key used in attestation.

            private static string ComputeDerivedSymmetricKey(string enrollmentKey, string deviceId)
            {
                if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(enrollmentKey))
                {
                    return enrollmentKey;
                }

                var key = "";
                using (var hmac = new HMACSHA256(Convert.FromBase64String(enrollmentKey)))
                {
                    key = Convert.ToBase64String(hmac.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(deviceId)));
                }

                return key;
            }
        }

    }
   ```

   >**Note**:  Be sure you only replace code in the **DeviceManager** class and not any other code in the file.

5. Save **DeviceManager.cs**.

### Task 2: Configure the DPS Group Enrollment Key and ID Scope

You will want to avoid entering the DPS Group Enrollment Key and ID Scope every time the project is run. To do this, you can set this value as the default text for the **DPS Group Enrollment Primary Key** and **DPS ID Scope** text boxes in the application. Follow these steps to configure the connection string:

1. Return to the **SmartMeterSimulator** solution in **Visual Studio** on your **Lab VM**.

2. In the **Solution Explorer**, expand the **SmartMeterSimulator** project and double-click **MainForm.cs** to open it. (If the Solution Explorer is not in the upper-right corner of your Visual Studio instance, you can find it under the View menu in Visual Studio.)

   ![In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, SmartMeterSimulator project is expanded, and under it, MainForm.cs is highlighted.](media/visual-studio-solution-explorer-mainform-cs.png 'Visual Studio Solution Explorer')

    > **Note**: If the file does not open. One of the project files may be blocked.

   - Open **Windows Explorer** and navigate to the starter project folder: **C:\SmartMeter\Hands-on lab\lab-files\starter-project\SmartMeterSimulator**.
   - Right-click on the **MainForm.resx** file, then select **Properties**.
   - Check the **Unblock** checkbox on the bottom of the **General** tab, then select **Apply** then **OK**.

   ![Right-click MainForm.resx, go to Properties, then check the box next to Unblock](media/image19.png 'Unblock file')

   - Close and reopen **Visual Studio**. Re-open the **MainForm.cs** file.

    >**Note**: If you are still unable to see the Windows Forms designer, close it, then right-click the project and select **Clean**. Then, right-click the project again and select **Build**. Now, you should be able to open the form without a problem.
    >
    >    ![Building and cleaning the solution to ensure that the Windows Forms editor shows up.](./media/image20.png "Building and cleaning solution")
  
3. In the **Windows Forms designer surface**, select the **DPS Group Enrollment Primary Key** textbox.

   ![The Windows Form designer surface is opened to the MainForm.cs tab. The DPS Group Enrollment Primary Key textbox is highlighted, but is empty.](./media/image21.png 'Windows Form designer surface')

4. In the **Properties** panel, scroll until you see the **Text** property. Paste your **DPS Enrollment Group Primary Key** value copied from Exercise 1, Task 4, Step 4 into the value for the **Text** property. (If the properties window is not visible below the Solution Explorer, right-click the TextBox, and select **Properties**.)

   ![In the Properties panel, the Text property is highlighted, and is populated.](./media/image22.png 'Textbox properties')

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to populate the **DPS ID Scope** textbox with the value you recorded in Exercise 1, Task 2, Step 6.

6. Your DPS Group Enrollment Primary Key and ID Scope should now be present every time you run the **Smart Meter Simulator**.

   ![The Windows Form designer surface is opened to the MainForm.cs tab. The IoT Hub Connection String now displays.](./media/image23.png 'IoT Hub Connection String dialog')

7. Save **MainForm.cs**.

### Task 3: Implement the communication of telemetry with IoT Hub

1. Open **Sensor.cs** from the **Solution Explorer**, and complete the **TODO** items 6 to 11 as indicated within the code that are responsible for transmitting telemetry data to the IoT Hub, as well as receiving data from IoT Hub.

2. The following code shows the completed result:

3. Save **Sensor.cs**.

### Task 4: Verify device registration and telemetry

In this task, you will build and run the Smart Meter Simulator project.

1. In **Visual Studio** select **Build** from the Visual Studio menu, then select **Build Solution**.

   ![The green Start button is highlighted on the Visual Studio toolbar.](media/image24.png 'Visual Studio toolbar')

2. Run the **Smart Meter Simulator**, by selecting the green **Start** button on the Visual Studio toolbar.

   ![The green Start button is highlighted on the Visual Studio toolbar.](media/image25.png 'Visual Studio toolbar')

3. Select one or more of the windows within the building to simulate the installation of a smart meter device. Once selected, the window will turn yellow.

    ![The smart meter simulator displays with three windows in yellow.](media/image26.png "The smart meter simulator")

4. Select **Register** on the **Smart Meter Simulator** window, this triggers the smart meter automatic registration through the enrollment group. It will take a few seconds for each of the yellow (installed) windows to turn to cyan, indicating the device is registered.

   ![The smart meter simulator window is shown with the previously yellow windows now displaying as cyan.](media/image27.png 'Fabrikam Smart Meter Simulator')

5. At this point, you have installed and registered one or more devices (in cyan). To view this list of devices, you will switch over to the **Azure Portal**, and open the **IoT Hub** you provisioned.

6. From the **IoT Hub** blade, select **IoT Devices** under **Explorers** on the left-hand menu.

   ![On the IoT Hub blade, in the Explorers section, under Explorers, IoT Devices is highlighted.](media/image28.png 'IoT Hub blade, Explorers section')

7. You should see all your registered devices listed having a status of **enabled**.

   ![Devices in the Device ID list have a status of either enabled or disabled.](media/image29.png 'Device ID list')

8. In the **Azure Portal**, open the Device Provisioning Service resource, then select **Manage enrollments** from the left menu. Select the **smartmeter-device-group** enrollment group.

    ![The DPS Manage enrollments screen is shown with Manage enrollments selected in the left menu and the smartmeter-device-group highlighted in the enrollment groups listing.](media/image30.png "Enrollment Groups Listing")

9. In the Enrollment Group Details screen, select the **Registration Records** tab and notice the devices selected for registration in the simulator application are listed.

    ![The DPS Enrollment Group Details screen displays with the Registration Records tab highlighted and a list of registered devices.](media/image31.png "Enrollment Group Registration Records")

10. Return to the **Smart Meter Simulator** window.

11. Select **Connect**. Within a few moments, you should begin to see activity as the windows change color, indicating the smart meters are transmitting telemetry. The grid on the left will list each telemetry message transmitted and the simulated temperature value.

    ![On the Smart Meter Simulator, the Connect button is highlighted, and one of the green windows has now turned to blue. The current windows count is now seven gray, two green, and one blue.](media/image32.png 'Fabrikam Smart Meter Simulator')

12. Allow the smart meter to continue to run for the duration of the lab.
