## Exercise 5: Sending commands to the IoT devices

Duration: 20 minutes

Fabrikam would like to send commands to devices from the cloud in order to control their behavior. In this exercise, you will send commands that control the temperature settings of individual devices.

### Task 1: Add your IoT Hub connection string to the CloudToDevice console app

This console app is configured to connect to IoT Hub using the same connection string you use in the SmartMeterSimulator app. Messages are sent from the console app to IoT Hub, specifying a device by its ID, for example **Device1**. IoT Hub then transmits that message to the device when it is connected. This is called a **cloud-to-device message**. The console app is not directly connecting to the device and sending it the message. All messages flow through IoT Hub where the connections and device state are managed.

1. Return to the **SmartMeterSimulator** solution in **Visual Studio** on your **Lab VM**.

2. In the **Solution Explorer**, expand the **CloudToDevice** project and open **Program.cs**. (If the Solution Explorer is not in the upper-right corner of your Visual Studio instance, you can find it under the View menu in Visual Studio.)

    ![In the Visual Studio Solution Explorer window, CloudToDevice is expanded, and under it, Program.cs is highlighted.](media/image75.png 'Visual Studio Solution Explorer')

3. Replace **YOUR-CONNECTION-STRING** on line 13 with your IoT Hub connection string. This is the same string you added to the Main form in the SmartMeterSimulator earlier. The line you need to update looks like this:

    ```csharp
    static string connectionString = "YOUR-CONNECTION-STRING";
    ```

    After updating, your **Program.cs** file should look similar to the following:

    ![The Program.cs file has been updated with the code change.](media/image76.png 'Program.cs')

4. Save the file.

### Task 2: Send cloud-to-device messages

In this task, you will leave the simulator running and separately launch the console app to start sending cloud-to-device messages.

1. If you hover over one of the windows, you will see a dialog display information about the associated device, including the Device ID (in this case, **Device0**), Device Key, Temperature, and Indicator. The legend on the bottom shows the indicator displayed for each temperature range. The Device ID is important when sending cloud-to-device messages, as this is how we will target a specific device when we remotely set the desired temperature. Keep the Device ID values in mind when sending the messages in the next task.

2. Within the **SmartMeterSimulator** Visual Studio solution, right-click the **CloudToDevice** project, select **Debug**, then select **Start new instance** to run the console app.

3. In the **console window**, enter a **device number** when prompted. Accepted values are 0-9, since there are 10 devices whose IDs begin with 0. You can hover over the windows in the **Smart Meter Simulator** to view the Device IDs. When you enter a number, such as `0`, then a message will be sent to **Device0**. Be certain to select the device number of a registered window!

    ![The value of 0 is entered when prompted for the device number in the console window.](media/console-device-number.png 'Console App')

4. Now enter a **temperature value** between 65 and 85 degrees (F) when prompted. If you set a value above 72 degrees, the window will turn red. If the value is set between 68 and 72 degrees, it will turn green. Values below 68 degrees will turn the window blue. Once you set a value, the device will remain at that value until you set a new value, rather than randomly changing.

    ![A value of 70 has been entered for the temperature. A new log entry in the Smart Meter Simulator appears in yellow showing the message value of 70 sent to Device0.](media/image90.png 'Console App and Smart Meter Simulator')

    If you run the **Smart Meter Simulator** side-by-side with the **console app**, you can observe the message logged by the Smart Meter Simulator within seconds. This message appears with a yellow background and displays the temperature request value sent to the device. In our case, we sent a request of 70 degrees to Device0. The console app indicates that it is sending the temperature request to the indicated device.

5. Hover over the device to which you sent the message. You will see that its temperature is set to the value you requested through the console app.

    ![Device0 is hovered over and the dialog appears showing the temperature set to the requested temperature.](media/image91.png 'Fabrikam Smart Meter Simulator')

6. In the console window, you can enter `Y` to send another message. Experiment with setting the temperature on other devices and observe the results.
