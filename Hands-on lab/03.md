## Exercise 1: IoT Hub and Device Provisioning Service deployment

Duration: 30 minutes

In your architecture design session with Fabrikam, it was agreed upon to use Azure Device Provisioning Service (DPS) to manage automatic device registration. The DPS would then assign an IoT Hub to the device that ingests telemetry from the Smart Meter Simulator. In this exercise, you will deploy an IoT Hub and DPS to enable device registration and connectivity.

### Task 1: Provision the IoT Hub

In these steps, you will provision an instance of IoT Hub.

1. In your browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+Create a resource** in the navigation pane, enter _IoT Hub_ into the **Search the Marketplace** box, and select **IoT Hub** from the results.

   !["IoT Hub" is entered into the Search the Marketplace box. IoT Hub is highlighted in the search results.](./media/image80.png 'Create an IoT Hub')

2. On the resource overview page, select **Create**.

3. On the **IoT Hub** screen, **Basics** tab, enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

   - **Resource group**: Choose Use existing and select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group.

   - **Region**: Select the location you are using for this hands-on lab.

   - **IoT Hub Name**: Enter a unique name, such as **smartmeter-hub-SUFFIX**.

     ![The Basics tab for IoT Hub is displayed, with the values specified above entered into the appropriate fields.](./media/image01.png 'Create IoT Hub Basics tab')

4. Select the **Management** tab. Accept the default Pricing and scale tier of **S1: Standard tier**, and select **Review + create**.

    ![The Management tab for IoT Hub is displayed with the Standard pricing tier selected.](media/image81.png 'Create IoT Hub Management tab')

5. Once validation has passed, select **Create**.

6. When the IoT Hub deployment is completed, you will receive a notification in the Azure portal. Select **Go to resource** in the notification.

7. From the **IoT Hub's Overview** blade, select **Shared access policies** under **Settings** on the left-hand menu and select **iothubowner** policy.

   ![Screenshot of the Overview blade, settings section. Under Settings, Shared access policies is highlighted.](./media/image05.png 'Overview blade, settings section')

8. In the **iothubowner** blade, select the **Copy** button to the right of the **Connection string - primary key** field. Record this value for a future task.

### Task 2: Deploy the Device Provisioning Service

In these steps, you will deploy an instance of the Device Provisioning Service (DPS).

1. In your browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+Create a resource** in the navigation pane, enter `IOT Hub Device Provisioning Service` into the **Search the Marketplace** box, and select **IoT Hub** from the results.

    ![The Search the Marketplace textbox is shown with IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service entered as the search criteria and is selected from the search results.](media/image07.png "Search the Marketplace")

2. On the resource overview page, select **Create**.

    ![The Search the Marketplace textbox is shown with IoT Hub Device Provisioning Service entered as the search criteria and is selected from the search results.](media/image08.png "Search the Marketplace")

3. On the IoT Hub device provisioning service **Basics** tab, complete the form as follows:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

   - **Resource group**: Choose Use existing and select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group.

   - **Name**: Enter a unique name, such as **smartmeter-dps-SUFFIX**.

   - **Region**: Select the location you are using for this hands-on lab.

    ![The DPS creation form Basics tab is shown populated with the above values.](media/image09.png "DPS Basics Tab")

4. Select **Review + create**, then once validation has passed, select **Create** once more to deploy the service.

    ![The DPS creation form Basics tab is shown populated with the above values.](media/image10.png "DPS Basics Tab")

5. When the DPS deployment is completed, select **Go to resource** on the deployment screen.

    ![The DPS Overview screen displays with the ID Scope field highlighted.](media/image11.png "DPS Overview screen.")

6. On the Overview screen of the Device Provisioning Service, copy and record the value for **ID Scope** for a future task.

    ![The DPS Overview screen displays with the ID Scope field highlighted.](media/image12.png "DPS Overview screen.")

### Task 3: Link the IoT Hub to the Device Provisioning Service

1. Remaining in the DPS resource, select **Linked IoT hubs** from the left menu, located beneath the **Settings** heading. Then select **+Add** from the toolbar.

    ![The DPS Linked IoT hubs screen is shown with Linked IoT hubs selected in the left menu and the +Add button highlighted in the toolbar.](media/image13.png "DPS Linked IoT hubs")

2. In the Add link to IoT hub blade, populate the form as follows, then select **Save**:

   - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.
   - **IoT Hub**: Select the **smartmeter-hub-{SUFFIX}** IoT Hub.
   - **Access Policy**: Select **iothubowner**.

### Task 4: Create an enrollment group

Creating an enrollment group enables Fabrikam to allow devices to self-register. This avoids the need to register each device manually. Group enrollments are made possible via secure Attestations, these could be via certificates or symmetric keys. In this example, we will use the symmetric key approach. Using symmetric keys should only be used in non-production scenarios, such as with this proof of concept.

1. Remaining in the DPS resource, select **Manage enrollments** from the left menu, then select **+Add enrollment group** from the toolbar menu.

    ![The DPS Manage enrollments screen displays with the Manage enrollments item selected from the left menu and the +Add enrollment group button highlighted on the toolbar.](media/image15.png "DPS Add enrollment group")

2. In the Add Enrollment Group form, populate it as follows, then select the **Save** button.

    - **Group name**: Enter **smartmeter-device-group**.
    - **Attestation Type**: Select **Symmetric Key**.
    - **Auto-generate keys**: Checked.
    - **IoT Edge device**: Select **False**.
    - **Select how you want to assign devices to hubs**: Select **Evenly weighted distribution**.
    - **Select the IoT hubs this group can be assigned to**: Select **smartmeter-hub-{SUFFIX}**.
    - **Select how you want the device data to be handled on re-provisioning**: Select **Re-provision and migrate data**.
    - **Initial Device Twin State**: Retain the default value.
    - **Enable entry**: Select **Enable**.

4. On the Enrollment Group Details screen, copy the **Primary Key** value and record it for a future task.
